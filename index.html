                I created this website as part of my portfolio of private projects.
                This is not meant to show off any great skills in the handling of HTML or dynamic websites, but rather
                a place for me to share my interests, to self advertise and to provide a professional web appearance for
                possible employees and head hunters, as well as friends, colleagues and family.
                By you visiting this website it has already done its job: Reaching you.
