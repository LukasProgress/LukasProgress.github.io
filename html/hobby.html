                <h3>üç≥ Cooking</h3>
                <p>
                    I love experimenting with different cuisines and trying out new recipes. My favorite dishes to cook
                    include Asian cuisine, especially Japanese and Chinese, as well as Italian pasta. I also love to
                    bake homemade bread. Cooking allows me to be creative and unwind after a long day.

                <h3>üé≤ Board Games</h3>
                <p>
                    Competitive strategy games like Mythic Battles, Ankh and Cthulhu Wars are some of my favorites. I
                    enjoy the social aspect of playing with friends, as well as the intellectual challenge they provide.

                <h3>üéπ Playing Piano</h3>
                <p>
                    Music has always been a big part of my life. I play classical and jazz piano, and enjoy improvising
                    whenever I find time. Playing the piano helps me relax and enhances my creativity.

                <h3>üíª Computer Science & Coding</h3>
                <p>
                    I am always exploring new technologies, working on personal projects, and diving into DevOps, cloud
                    computing, and automation. Coding is both my profession and my hobby, making it a deeply fulfilling
                    activity.

                <h3>üé≠ Theatre</h3>
                <p>
                    Acting in a local student theatre group allows me to step into different roles and experience
                    storytelling from a whole new perspective. It also helps with confidence and public speaking a LOT.
                    The friends I made in the theatre group became almost like a family and I count some of them to be
                    my closest friends.
